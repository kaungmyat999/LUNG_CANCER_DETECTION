# LUNG CANCER DETECTION PROJECT

This project create lung cacer detection model using the kaggle dataset.

## Project Topic :zap:

This project is about creating lung cancer detection using Supervised
Machine learning Algorithms. This project outcome is to help the
physicians to help and save time in identifying the nodules present
in CT lung images in the early stage of lung cancer. Since that
process is the time consuming and very critical

## Motive :bulb:
The effectiveness of the cancer prediction system helps people to
know their cancer risk at a low cost and it also helps the people to
take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status. The
data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction
system.

## Dataset :bar_chart:

Data is a Public kaggle dataset which is called Lung Cancer.
Source: Kaggle
